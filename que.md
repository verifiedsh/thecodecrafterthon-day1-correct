## CODECRAFTERS — HACKATHON CHALLENGE
##     THE CLI CALCULATOR
  Two phases. One calculator. Build it in stages.
  Rules:
 → DO NOT USE GOOGLE OR ANY AI TOOL; DO IT YOURSELF - you can share ideas with others, but not copy code.
  → Write everything in Go. Standard library only.
  → Must compile and run without errors.
  → Push to your the-codecrafters repo in a folder
    named: thecodecrafterthon-day1/
  → Include a README.md explaining how to run it.
  → Complete Phase 1 before opening Phase 2.
  → Deadline: 2 hours from — GO.
##   PHASE 1 — GET IT WORKING
  Build a calculator that runs in the terminal,
  accepts user input, and keeps going until
  you decide to stop.
  WHAT TO BUILD
- OPERATIONS
  The user types an expression. The calculator
  responds with the result. Support:
     add <a> <b>   → addition
     sub <a> <b>   → subtraction
     mul <a> <b>   → multiplication
     div <a> <b>   → division
  Example interaction:
     > add 10 4
       ✦ Result: 14
     > mul 3 7
       ✦ Result: 21
-  KEEP IT RUNNING
  The calculator must not stop after one result.
  It waits for the next input, and the next,
  until the user types:
     quit   → exits with a goodbye message
- HELP
  Typing help prints a clean list of all
  supported commands and how to use them.
##  VALIDATION — HANDLE ALL OF THESE CLEANLY
  → Division by zero
    must print a clear error. Not a crash.
  → Letters where numbers are expected
    e.g. "add cat dog"
    must print a clear error. Not a crash.
  → Wrong number of arguments
    e.g. "add 5" or "mul 1 2 3"
    must be caught and explained to the user.
  → Unknown commands
    must suggest typing "help".
  → Negative numbers must work perfectly.
    e.g. "add -10 -5  →  -15"
  The golden rule:
  ✦ Nothing the user types should ever
    crash your program. Ever.
##  THINK ABOUT
  → How do you read and split user input cleanly?
  → How do you validate before you calculate?
  → What does a helpful error message look like?
  → How do you structure your operations so the
    code doesn't become one giant if-else chain?
## PHASE 1 IS DONE WHEN:
  → All 4 operations work correctly.
  → Every bad input is handled — no crashes.
  → quit exits cleanly.
  → help displays usage.
  → Code is committed and pushed.
